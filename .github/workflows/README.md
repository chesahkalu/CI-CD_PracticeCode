# Create a CI pipeline with GitHub Actions

This guide explains the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline set up in this repository using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites
Before you work with this CI pipeline, ensure you have:

- A GitHub account and access to this repository.
- Python 3.9 and a virtual environment set up in your local development environment.
- Necessary Python dependencies installed (refer to requirements.txt).
- Linting tools (Flake8) and testing frameworks (PyUnit) installed.


## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions are a way to automate tasks within GitHub. You can create workflows that will run when certain events occur. For example, you can create a workflow that will run when a pull request is created or when a commit is pushed to a branch. You can also create workflows that will run on a schedule. Workflows are defined in a YAML file in a `.github/workflows` folder in your repository. You can create multiple workflows in a repository. Our CI pipeline, defined in .github/workflows/workflow.yml, triggers automated tasks like linting and testing each time commits are pushed to main or a pull request is made.

## Creating and Modifying Workflows

To create or modify a workflow:

1. Go to the .github/workflows folder.
2. Create or edit a YAML file (like workflow.yml).
3. Define jobs and steps based on your CI requirements.
    - Jobs run in parallel and contain a series of steps.
    - Steps can be shell commands or actions (reusable code snippets).
    - Actions can be sourced from GitHub, the GitHub community, or custom-defined in the .github/actions folder.
4. Commit and push your changes to the repository.

## Workflow Steps

The [workflow.yml](.github/workflows/workflow.yml) file  shows a well commented workflow that contains the following steps:

- Checkout: The repository's code is checked out for the workflow.
- Install Dependencies: Sets up the required environment by installing dependencies.
- Lint with Flake8: Performs linting on the code to maintain code quality.
- Run Unit Tests: Executes unit tests to ensure all components work as expected.

## Utilizing GitHub Actions

- GitHub Actions offer a versatile way to automate workflows, including:
- Triggering workflows on push/pull requests.
- Running tasks on a schedule.
- Reusing actions from GitHub Marketplace or community contributions.

## Conclusion
This CI pipeline is an integral part of our development process, ensuring code quality and reliability with every change made to the repository. It is also a great example of how GitHub Actions can be used to automate workflows.
